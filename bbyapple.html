	<h1 style="font-size: 55; font-family:'alfa-slab-one;" class="h15">I believe I have shaped myself into the person I have become today. I have changed so much as a person. i’m learning to love myself and not be so hard on myself. ive started to look at myself like I would look at a friend. I would never be as hard on my friends as I would be to myself. i’m starting to become more self aware. I have been through hell and back and starting to realize that there are so many other people that are going through their own battles and to be considerate of their feelings/thoughts as well as my own. I have been down a hell of a long road and came along way. Pat yourself on the back. You deserve it</h1>
