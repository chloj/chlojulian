They have instilled healthy relationship habits in me purely through example. Because of them I know how to love and treat everyone with kindness and patience. They are always positive. Here is a poem by e.h. that reminds me of them both. "She sprouted love like flowers, Grew a garden in her mind, And even on the darkest days, From her smile the sun still shined."
