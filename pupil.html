<h1 style="font-size: 38; font-family:'alfa-slab-one;" class="h6">When I was younger my dad abused my mother, my sister and me. Seeing how weak of a man he was to resort to violence when life wasn’t going his way.It made me realize that I will forever be respectful, strong and courageous. I made a promise to myself that I will never be as low of a man as he was to lay my hands on the defenseless. Something that got me through this time is Joshua 1:9

“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.”</h1>
